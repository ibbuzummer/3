        <p>Chrysalis High - Yelahanka New Town is located in the heart of Yelahanka, just 500 meters from Yelahanka Police Station & is affiliated with CBSE. A protected space to grow and develop, to unfold and explore, a foothold to grip and fly …<br>
            <br> The school campus is spread over a sprawling 2-acre area with lots of facilities for outdoor activities that include
            <span style="color:#FF0000"><i> a semi-Olympic size swimming pool, skating rink, basketball court, cricket pitch and a comfortable play area for tiny tots.</i></span>

    <h2>
        <p>Chrysalis is a journey for the nascent. Charles Darwin explains the school as the
            <span style="color:#0000FF;">“proper place on which to become attached and undergo the final metamorphosis.” </span><br>
            <br> In this golden age of childhood, children need a protected place which shelters the vulnerable and allows them the space and the freedom to transform themselves to their full glory. <br>
            <br> Children are innocent beings, to be treated with utmost care and responsibility till the time they are strong enough to soar.<br>
            <br> At
            <span style="color:#FF234A;font-weight:900;font-variant:small-caps;">Chrysalis High,</span> this is exactly what we help the children do. <span class=" blink ">Soar .. !</span>

        playing basket ball were very much encouraged by teachers.</span><br><br>I was even asked to play keyboard during school activities and functions.
